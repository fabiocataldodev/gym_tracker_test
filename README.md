Technologies Used

•	Flutter: A framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.


•	GetX: A powerful and lightweight solution for state management, route management, and dependency injection. Chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in managing state and routes without boilerplate code.

•	GetStorage: A simple and efficient key-value storage system. Selected for its ease of use and minimal setup compared to alternatives like SharedPreferences or Hive.

•	Mockito: A library for creating mocks and stubs. Used in unit testing to simulate dependencies and verify that functions and interactions behave as expected.
